A California resident reports they met “Bowen” on WeChat and WhatsApp. Bowen shared personal information and pictures of himself, such as by sharing that he worked at a Tesla factory in Fremont. Then, Bowen told the victim he had a friend who had been earning consistent returns trading crypto for the last 10 years. Bowen gave step-by-step instructions to the victim on how to trade crypto like his friend by first downloading an app called Trust. The victim borrowed nearly $370,000 from friends and family to trade crypto on the app. The app even claimed to provide a “10% bonus” to the victim for whatever money they deposited.

However, when the victim tried to withdraw their money from the app, they were told they had to first pay $150,000 for “personal taxes”. When the victim paid the money, they were then told they needed to pay a $90,000 “deposit”. The victim paid the $90,000, but was still unable to withdraw anything from the app. The app claimed there was an issue with the blockchain. The app is no longer responding to the victim. The victim has since lost access to her account and has been unable to contact Bowen. All told, the victim transferred $368,000 to the app.

In conclusion, The victim was directed and introduced to a professional hacker; GAVIN CRYTO RECOVERIES. Their work is to help you reclaim your scammed crytos. You can contact them on
